 A tool to help users make decisions
 
 After having read the book "Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions" by Brain Christian and Tom Griffiths, I was interested in implementing some of the techniques they discussed for decision making which led to this. This will allow you to make a decision on any subject matter with the possibility of only having to look at about a third of the items you're picking between. The magic of this is that there is also about a 50% chance that whatever is picked is truly the best item in the set, and regardless it will definitely be a relatively good decision.
